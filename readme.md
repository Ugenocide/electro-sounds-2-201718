## Semester 2

Creative Coding has become a household name in various art, design and music communities around the world. In addition to the traditional and established means and skills for creative expression in education and industry, coding as a skill has experienced continuous growth.


Since the early 2000s, various coding frameworks and communities have been created that have produced a variety of learning tools and creative outcomes generated by the use of code and other technologies. Being code literate has become a desirable skill for a variety of practices and professions in the creative industries and other industries.

With an initial focus on generating screen-based results, the range of applications and artistic expressions has been highly diversified and now includes outcomes that affect sound, interactivity, advanced technologies, physical objects, data and more.

This semester, we will focus on the skills and strategies that are essential for generating sound and image using code and algorithms. You will use and create your own generative systems with a range of coding techniques and good ideas. First, a quote from Philip Galanter from his article What is Generative Art?

> Generative art refers to any art practice where the artist uses a system, such as a set of natural language rules, a computer program, a machine, or other procedural invention, which is set into motion with some degree of autonomy contributing to or resulting in a completed work of art.

_P. Galanter, "What is Generative Art? Complexity theory as a context for art theory," in International Conference on Generative Art, Milan, Italy, 2003._


In this course we will focus on the technical aspects of coding, but it is strongly recommended that you immerse yourself in the subject with an open mind for cultural, theoretical and contextual discussions to shape your artistic thinking and creativity. A number of examples and starting points are offered and discussed during the lessons and in this document.


## Sessions
There will be 5 sessions this semester. Each week we will meet for 3 hours. Optional and upon appointment you can book individual tutorials (up to 30 minutes).


### Session 1
**Getting Started: Week 2-4**. For this class we will primarily use JavaScript for the coding exercises. First, we will get to know the JavaScript library [p5js](https://p5js.org/) and how to use the browser as a development environment along with the [Atom](https://atom.io/) Text Editor . During this session, you will learn a number of programming principles that will help you create generative visual representations using code. Let's go to [Session 1](./session-1/readme.md).

### Session 2
This session will look at the beauty of algorithms and data through randomness, noise, data streams and recursion. Find more details under [Session 2](./session-2/readme.md).

### Session 3
For this session you will work on a written proposal for your web-based Realtime Visuals application. Details and structure are outline under [session-3](./session-3/readme.md).

## Assignments

This semester you will learn about coding, generative systems, processes and visuals. The assignments given this semester will help you exercise and practice a range of coding techniques to create Web-based Realtime Visuals.

All your assignments must be uploaded to your repository on Github. If you do not yet have a Github account, create one and a repository for this class.

1. **Assignment A** Create a series of 3 sketches that resemble one work of each of the following artists: Frieder Nake, Sol Lewitt, Ryoji Ikeda.
  - Sketch size is 960x540px
  - Add reference image to the sketch folder
  - Due: week 5
2. **Assignment B** Use a selection of your current Processing sketches which use code to animate abstract, geometric visuals. Create a browser application and add your own sound track that supports your visuals.
  - Sketch size: fullscreen
  - Due: week 10
3. **Assignment C** Write a project proposal for a Web-based Realtime Visuals application, details see [session-3](./session-3/readme.md). The proposal requires you to include references (at least 3). Choose one reference artist or a project from the Processing Exhibition that relates to one or more of the following topics: Generative Art, Sound Art, Algorave and describe in 150 words why you like the artist's work and why it is relevant to your proposed project.
  - Due: week 11
4. **Assignment D** Create a browser based application using your own sound track and a range of coding techniques you have learned so far. Use at least one item from each of the following sections to focus your work:
  - **A** algorithmic, generative, interactive, geometric
  - **B** camera reactive, audio reactive, shaders,
  - **C** GUI, live performance, midi, animated-gifs
  - **D** mellow, calm, suspense, frantic, fast
Assignment D, the final project, must be hosted on Github together with assignment A,B,C. Please see the *Submission Guidelines* for more details. The final project must be accompanied by a project Description (200 words), Technical Description (150 words), 3 representative project images and your References.
  - Work-check: week 14
  - Due: week 16

## Misc

  1. To keep your code organised and in one place, use Github (create an account for free) to host your code repositories. Github offers a GUI [desktop app](https://desktop.github.com/) that makes it very easy to create and update repositories. Please read through
    - [Getting your project on Github](https://guides.github.com/introduction/getting-your-project-on-github/) using the github Desktop application
    - [Github's Clone to Desktop](http://joe.blog.freemansoft.com/2014/04/github-clone-to-desktop-with-windows.html) shows you how to clone a repository to your local desktop using Github's Desktop application. This is very useful to for example keep track of the class repository which will continuously be updated as we proceed.
  2. Some exercises require you to write short texts which are write in markdown ([what is it](https://daringfireball.net/projects/markdown/), [cheatsheet](https://github.com/adam-p/markdown-here/wiki/Markdown-Cheatsheet), [tutorial](https://www.markdowntutorial.com)),
  3. A very simple formatting syntax for writing text in text editors like TextEdit, Sublime Text, or Atom. On maxos add a markdown quickview (for example [qlmarkdown](https://github.com/toland/qlmarkdown/releases) but there are more out there) to see your document rendered in markdown when quick-viewing it.
	4. How to convert your markdown document to pdf? Use [mdpdf](https://github.com/BlueHatbRit/mdpdf)
  4. Some insightful tips about being a beginner, intermediate or advanced programmer: [A guide on how to be a programmer](https://github.com/braydie/HowToBeAProgrammer)
  5. To convert a video to another format, consider using the open source video transcoder [handbrake](https://handbrake.fr/)
