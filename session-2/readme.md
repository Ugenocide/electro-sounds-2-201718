# Electro Sounds – Session 2: Algorithms and Data

This session will look at the beauty of algorithms and data through randomness, noise, data streams and recursion.

An algorithm is a set of rules to be followed in calculations or other problem-solving operations, especially by a computer. An algorithm is a procedure or formula for solving a problem, based on conducting a sequence of specified actions. What is an algorithm and why should you care? explained on Khan Academy [link](https://www.youtube.com/watch?time_continue=27&v=CvSOaYi89B4). A programming environment often comes with a set of predefined algorithms, however this should not stop you from defining your own algorithms or implementing missing algorithms to achieve necessary calculations and outcomes to express your ideas.

Data often refers to unstructured facts, figures or numbers – data is fragments, bits of information, but not information itself. When data is processed, interpreted, organised or presented, so as to make them meaningful or useful, they are called information. Information provides context for data. When data is put into context, it takes on different forms which can be of analytical nature such as a written report, a data visualisation or it can be represented in very abstract ways – sonically, or visually. The latter is what we are interested in exploring in this session. You will create a series of processing sketches that helps you practice and better understand the structure of computer programmes, the application of algorithms, the beauty of data.

## Starting Points
To get started with session 2, we will look at numbers and in particular random numbers, noise, and data streams.

### Randomness
Randomness by definition is the lack of pattern or predictability of events.
- Random function
- Random walk
- Random number generators

### Noise
- Noise function
- Perlin Noise
- Simplex Noise

### Data streams
- Audio input
- waveforms
- Fast Fourier Transformation
- Amplitude

### Algorithm
- Displaying data
- Analysing data
- Transforming data
- Abstracting data


### Algorithm, examples
The following topics should serve as a starting point to explore and practice algorithms and the techniques used to create them. The topics below follow the code examples from [form and code](http://formandcode.com/code-examples/)
- Repeat
  - Iterative
  - Recursive
- Transforming
  - Transcoding
  - Slit-Scan
- Parameterize
- Simulate
  - Particles
  - Cellular automata
  - Noise
- Recursion
	- Fractals
	- L-systems
- Glitch
